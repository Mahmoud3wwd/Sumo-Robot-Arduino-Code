# SUMO Robot

Welcome to the repository for the SUMO Robot project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a SUMO robot equipped with 4 wheels, 2 motor controllers, 5 proximity sensors, and 4 line sensors.

## Overview

The SUMO Robot is designed for competitive SUMO robot challenges. It features:

- **4 Wheels:** For enhanced maneuverability and stability.
- **2 Motor Controllers:** To manage the movement of the wheels.
- **5 Proximity Sensors:** For obstacle detection and collision avoidance.
- **4 Line Sensors:** For line following and boundary detection.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot can navigate and avoid obstacles using proximity sensors.
- **Line Following:** The robot can follow lines on the ground using the line sensors.
- **Competitive Performance:** Designed to compete in SUMO robot tournaments.

## Strategy

The SUMO Robot uses two distinct strategies:

1. **Circular Attack:** When engaging with an opponent, the robot uses a circular movement pattern to attack. This strategy helps in maintaining a constant approach angle and can be effective in disorienting opponents.

2. **Random Search:** For locating opponents, the robot employs a random search pattern. This strategy allows the robot to cover a larger area and increases the likelihood of encountering opponents during the match.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SUMO Robot, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (if using Arduino for motor control)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if using Python for sensor data processing)
- Relevant libraries and drivers for your motor controllers and sensors.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/Mahmoud3wwd/Sumo-Robot-Arduino-Code)
