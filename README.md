# SUMO Robot

Welcome to the repository for the SUMO Robot project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a SUMO robot equipped with 4 wheels, 2 motor controllers, 5 proximity sensors, and 4 line sensors.

## Overview

The SUMO Robot is designed for competitive SUMO robot challenges. It features:

- **4 Wheels:** For enhanced maneuverability and stability.
- **2 Motor Controllers:** To manage the movement of the wheels.
- **5 Proximity Sensors:** For obstacle detection and collision avoidance.
- **4 Line Sensors:** For line following and boundary detection.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot can navigate and avoid obstacles using proximity sensors.
- **Line Following:** The robot can follow lines on the ground using the line sensors.
- **Competitive Performance:** Designed to compete in SUMO robot tournaments.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SUMO Robot, follow these instructions:
